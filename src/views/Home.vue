            Humans, we all know how important fruits and vegetables are for our
            health. Abundant in vitamins, minerals, and fiber and low in
            calories, fruits and veggies are some of the most nutritious things
            that we can eat. It might also surprise you to know that some of
            these delicious and nutritious foods can also be beneficial to your
            petâ€™s health.

              Although many of us like to share household food with our furry
              friends, not all human food is appropriate or safe for your pet to
              eat. To help you out, the experienced vets at Avondale Animal
              Hospital have put together this guide to fruits and veggies your
              pet can safely enjoy.

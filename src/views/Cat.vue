          Fruits and Veggies that are Safe for Cats Cats are carnivores, which
          means that their diet should be primarily protein-based. Your feline
          friend doesn’t actually need fruits or vegetables in her diet to
          remain healthy, but they do make a good alternative to high-calorie
          treats. Here are some of the safest fruits and vegetables that you can
          share with your kitty.
